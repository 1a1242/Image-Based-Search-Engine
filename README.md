# Image-Based Search Engine

The Image-Based Search Engine is an intelligent system that enables users to retrieve relevant URLs based on uploaded images. It utilizes image processing, face detection, and web scraping techniques to provide a seamless and visually-driven approach to information retrieval.

## Features

- Face detection: The system employs advanced face detection algorithms to identify and extract facial regions from uploaded images.
- Web scraping: URLs related to the image content are retrieved by searching for visually similar or contextually relevant web pages.
- User-friendly interface: A web page interface allows users to easily upload images and obtain a curated list of URLs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/1a1242/Image-Based-Search-Engine.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the application: `python3 -m streamlit run web_app.py`

### Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`
2. Upload an image using the provided interface.
3. View the curated list of URLs related to the uploaded image.
4. Click on the URLs to navigate to the respective web pages.

## Future Enhancements

- Refinement of face detection algorithms for improved accuracy.
